# Figure 15

The R code to run the methods (and the respective outputs) is in the following folders:

1. LASSO Merged: "~/LASSO"
---Raw: "LASSO Merged Tuned (4-4-19).R"
---Derivative: "LASSO Merged Diff (8-2-18).R"

2. PCR Merged:  "~/PCR"
---Raw: "PCR Merged Expedited Tuning (7-16-18).R"
---Derivative: "PCR Merged Diff Expedited Tuning (7-16-18).R

The output files are in "PCR Output FIles" and "LASSO Output Files."

## Figure Generation

The code that takes that output and generates the Figure is in "Box and Whisker Plot of LASSO vs PCR.R". The working directories will need to be changed when reading in the output files. The methods were run on Harvard Odyssey's cluster ("general" partition).
