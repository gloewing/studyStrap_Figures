# Figures and Methods Code

The R code to run the methods is in the folders associated with the corresponding figure (or table). These include the output files generated from the Harvard Odyssey ("general" or "shared" partition) cluster on which the methods were run. All figures were generated on a a macOSX 10.12.6 personal computer.

Some of the methods (R code) will require data and functions given in the folder "Functions and Data"

Folders generally include the output files, the R code to run the methods and the R code to take the output files (results) and generate the figure. Almost all files will require changing the working directories both for the actual methods code and for generating figures. The working directories of the data, functions and the output (results) will have to be changed depending on where the files are saved.

Table 2 is included in the Figure 5 folder.
