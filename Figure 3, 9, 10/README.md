# Figures 3, 9 and 10

The R code to run the simulations and methods is in "~/Simulations/Simulation R Code". Each file is for a different simulation scenario. These were run on the Harvard Odyssey Cluster ("general" partition). 

The output from the simulations is in Folder "~/Simulations/Results (Simulation Output Files)". 

## Figure Generation

The code that takes that output and generates Figures 3a and 9 is in "Bag Size Curves AR AlgorithmLog.R"  The code that takes that output and generates Figures 3b and 10 is in "Bag Size Curve SSLog.R" The working directory will have to be changed appropriately in this file to retrieve the output files from "~/Simulations/Results (Simulation Output Files)"
