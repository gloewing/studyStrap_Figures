# Figures 2 and 8 Generation

## Simulations
The R code to run the simulations and methods is in "~/Simulations/Simulation R Code". Each file is for a different simulation scenario. These were run on the Harvard Odyssey Cluster ("general" partition). 

The output from the simulations is in Folder "~/Simulations/Results (Simulation Output Files)." 

## Figure Generation
The code that takes that output and generates figures 2 and 8 is "Box and Whisker Plot and Table of Simulations- Log Common Legend.R"
