# Table 1 Generation

The R code to run the simulations and methods is in "~/Simulations/Simulation R Code". Each file is for a different simulation scenario. These were run on the Harvard Odyssey Cluster ("general" partition). 

The output from the simulations is in Folder "~/Simulations/Results (Simulation Output Files)." 


The code that takes that output and generates the tables is in "Simulations Table.R." The working directory will have to be changed appropriately in this file.
