# Data

The full dataset is available (open source): https://osf.io/tb8fx/

A subset of the data is available here (this includes a random sample of all electrodes/datasets). Each row is a sample. The study label is "Electrode", the outcome is "DA." "pH" is a nuisance variable not included in analyses. The remainder of the columns are the covaraites.
